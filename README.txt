== Description ==

A blog-focused theme with a design aesthetic centered around minimalism and animation. Created using
the Materialize framework, this theme utilizes big and beautiful typography which enhances readability and
automatically adjusts to take advantage of a wide variety of screen sizes. Fluid animations help bring life
to otherwise static content, giving your site a more modern appeal. Minimal was designed to be completely
responsive and to showcase your content, meaning your site always looks great whether itâ€™s on a smartphone,
tablet, laptop, or desktop computer.

== Changelog ==

Initial release


== Notes ==

- When viewing the site in Edit mode (with the black WordPress admin bar floating up top) you might notice
  that the title animation scrolls up slightly then begins to fade. This is not the expected behavior and
  is due to the admin bar offsetting the title animation's trigger. This will only occur in Edit mode.
  The title animation will function correctly when viewing the published site (i.e. after you have logged
  out of wordpress and the admin bar disappears).

  TL;DR -> The title animation will behave differently in Edit mode, but will work fine when the site is published.


- When using this theme, the recommended size for featured images is between 800px - 1500px wide.
  Images less than that will appear left aligned and won't span the width of the content area.
  Images greater than that will take too long too load.


- Icons Explained
  * A grey lock icon will appear next to the title of a post that is password protected.
  * A purple visibility-off icon will apear next to the title of a post that is private.
  * A small person icon will appear next to the username of a comment written by the post author.
