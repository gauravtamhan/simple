== Description ==

A blog-focused theme with a design aesthetic centered around minimalism and animation. Created using the MaterializeCSS framework, this theme utilizes big and beautiful typography which enhances readability and automatically adjusts to take advantage of a wide variety of screen sizes. Fluid animations help bring life to otherwise static content, giving your site a more modern appeal. Minimal was designed to be completely responsive and to showcase your content, meaning your site always looks great whether itâ€™s on a smartphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer.
