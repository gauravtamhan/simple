Description: A blog-focused theme with a design aesthetic centered around minimalism and animation.

Fluid animations help bring life to otherwise static content, giving your site a more modern appeal. Minimal was designed to be completely responsive and to showcase your content, meaning your site always looks great whether itâ€™s on a smartphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer.
